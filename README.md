# PokemonZ
This one was my semestral project in Java and we were allowed to programm anything we wanted. I really like Pokémon and decided to create a simple console Pokémon game.
Contains Pokemons, Typing, Weaknesses, Encounters, Items, Fighting, Catching, Healing, Pokemon Centres, Gyms, Shops, NPCs, Gym badges, HMs, TMs, obstacles, leveling, evolving, money, PC where you could store Pokemon, saving progress into slots, loading progress from slots.
Tried to do it as real as possible, but without GUI.
